AAAAAAAH! ðŸ¤©
Guys, Iâ€™m so happy this is FINALLY OUT!! I started work on this project last December. They told us to bring something to do after we were done with finals, and well, I brought a notebook! I spent an hour and ten minutes throwing names and ideas into a book. Now, 7 and a half months later, (with a rather substantial mental health break and my HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION in between), I am thrilled to bring you all my first film!
A huge thank you to Mrs. J for trusting me with the schoolâ€™s equipment (which I didnâ€™t return until the last POSSIBLE minute ðŸ˜…) and staying after school so late on SO many days to let me edit. Another huge thanks to Mr. M, who encouraged me to keep going when I felt like giving up, and who gave me confidence in my work from the first day I told him the idea. Shoutout to the kids of the MISC media club, who all said they couldnâ€™t wait to see this. And one more big thanks to my best friend for acting as my on-location camera man, and for throwing bags of gummy bears at me more times than I can count.
I donâ€™t know how this video is going to do, but nothing will ever change how proud I am of it. I canâ€™t wait to show you guys whatâ€™s next. (Was the Grammarly joke obvious enough?)
