The highly anticipated addition to the Deadpool franchise, Deadpool and Wolverine, has finally arrived, six years after Deadpool 2. With so much time passing, fans were eager to see if the film would live up to its considerable hype.

Reception online has been mixed but generally leans toward the positive. Despite the change in production from 20th Century Fox to Disney, the movie remains true to the irreverent tone and style that fans have come to expect from the series. It serves as a fitting sendoff to the Fox era of Marvel movies, marking a significant transition in the franchise's history.

While the story may leave some viewers wanting more, it fulfills its role in continuing Deadpool’s chaotic journey. The acting, especially Hugh Jackman’s reprisal of Wolverine, is top-notch, adding depth and charisma to the film. Fans can also look forward to an array of cameos and surprise appearances that are not only delightful but also relevant to the plot.

A highlight of Deadpool and Wolverine is its soundtrack, featuring iconic tracks from Madonna, N-Sync, AC/DC, and more, continuing the series’ tradition of stellar music choices. The opening credits sequence is another standout, arguably the best of the trilogy.

While this movie might not appeal to everyone, especially those unfamiliar with the non-MCU Marvel films, fans of the first two Deadpool movies will likely enjoy this latest entry. If you’ve watched at least one non-MCU Marvel movie, Deadpool and Wolverine is worth a shot!
